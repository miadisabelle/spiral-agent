## ✅ STRENGTHS

- (No specific strengths identified in this pass)

---

## ⚠️ WEAKNESSES

- Missing or weak climax - the story needs a clear emotional/structural peak
- Weak cause-effect chain - events feel disconnected
- Unclear stakes - what does the protagonist risk?

---

## 💡 ACTIONABLE SUGGESTIONS

1. Identify the moment of highest tension and expand it into a full scene
2. Strengthen causal links between plot points - each event should flow naturally from the previous
3. Explicitly establish what the character stands to lose

---

## 🔍 OBSERVATIONS

The narrative demonstrates structural ambiguity. The inciting incident needs strengthening. The narrative lacks a clear climactic moment. The cause-effect chain scores 40%, suggesting gaps in narrative logic.
