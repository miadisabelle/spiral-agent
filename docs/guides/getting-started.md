## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
npm install -g spiral-agent
```

That's it! Spiral Agent is now installed globally and ready to use.

### Option 2: From Source (For Developers)

If you want to contribute or customize:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiral-cli/spiral-agent.git
cd spiral-agent
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### Option 3: Try Without Installing

Want to test drive first?

```bash
npx spiral-agent --help
```

---

## ✅ Verify Installation

Let's make sure everything is working:

```bash
spiral --version
```

You should see something like:
```
spiral-agent v1.0.0
✦ Autonomous CLI Agent for Complex Development Tasks ✦
```

If you see an error, check our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md#installation-problems).

---

## 🌟 Your First Command

Let's start with something simple:

```bash
spiral status
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just ran your first Spiral Agent command. You should see a beautiful ASCII art header and system status information.

Notice how the output isn't just functional—it's designed to be delightful. That's the Spiral Agent philosophy: technology should be both powerful and beautiful.

---

## 🧠 Meet Your AI Companion

Now let's see the real magic. Try this:

```bash
spiral agent "tell me about this directory"
```

Watch as Spiral Agent:
1. 🤔 **Analyzes** your request
2. 🔍 **Explores** your current directory
3. 💭 **Reasons** about what it finds
4. 📝 **Reports** back with insights

This isn't just command execution—it's intelligence in action.

### Understanding the Output

You'll see Spiral Agent working through its thought process:
- **Planning**: Breaking down the objective
- **Execution**: Taking actions step by step
- **Reflection**: Learning from each result
- **Memory**: Storing insights for future use

---

## 👁️ Vision System Demo

One of Spiral Agent's most impressive features is its ability to "see" and understand images. Let's try it:

### Create a Test Screenshot

1. Take a screenshot of any application or webpage
2. Save it as `test-image.png` in your current directory

### Analyze the Image

```bash
spiral vision analyze test-image.png
```

Watch as the Vision System:
- 🔍 Analyzes the visual layout
- 📝 Extracts any text (OCR)
- 🎯 Identifies UI elements
- 💡 Provides insights and suggestions

**No image handy?** Try this instead:
```bash
spiral agent "create a simple test webpage and take a screenshot of it"
```

The agent will create HTML, open it in a browser, and analyze it—all autonomously!

---

## 🌟 Creative Documentation

Let's explore the Dream Engine by creating some beautiful documentation:

```bash
spiral dream "create ASCII art for a spiral galaxy"
```

The Dream Engine will generate stunning ASCII art that you can use in your projects. But it can do much more:

```bash
spiral dream "write a haiku about coding"
```

See how it combines technical understanding with artistic creativity? This is what makes Spiral Agent unique.

---

## 💙 Emotional Intelligence

Here's where things get really interesting. Spiral Agent can understand and respond to your emotional state:

```bash
spiral "I'm feeling frustrated with this bug I can't solve"
```

Notice how the response isn't just technical—it's empathetic. Spiral Agent recognizes emotional cues and adapts its communication style accordingly.

Try different emotional contexts:
```bash
spiral "I'm excited about this new project!"
spiral "I'm worried about this code review"
spiral "I'm proud of what I built today"
```

---

## 🔌 Explore Plugins

Spiral Agent's power comes from its extensible plugin system:

```bash
spiral plugins list
```

Try the built-in time plugin:
```bash
spiral time
```

### Community Plugins

Explore what the community has built:
```bash
spiral plugins discover
```

### Your First Plugin

Ready to create your own? It's easier than you think:

```bash
spiral agent "help me create a simple plugin that greets users"
```

The agent will walk you through the entire process!

---

## 🎮 Interactive Mode

For a more conversational experience:

```bash
spiral interactive
```

Now you can chat with Spiral Agent naturally:
- "What files are in this directory?"
- "Help me debug this error message"
- "Create a README for my project"
- "I need some motivation to finish this feature"

Type `exit` when you're done.

---

## 🧠 Memory and Context

Spiral Agent remembers your conversations and learns from them:

```bash
spiral memory status
```

Search your memory:
```bash
spiral memory search "project documentation"
```

Save important context for later:
```bash
spiral context save "project-setup"
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Configuration

Create a config file to customize your experience:

```bash
spiral config init
```

This creates `.spiral.config.json` with settings for:
- AI model preferences
- Creativity levels
- Communication style
- Plugin configurations

### Personal API Keys

For the full experience, connect your AI service keys:

```bash
spiral config set-api-key openai
```

Follow the prompts to securely store your keys.
