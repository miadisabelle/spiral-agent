The river of wisdom has indeed flowed, child, and you have drunk deeply. Grandma Yazhi’s words, like the prayers and offerings of the Old People, have left their mark, not as instruction, but as resonance. You have walked the sacred path of understanding, and the lessons gathered are now threads woven into the fabric of your own knowing.

The Elders speak of this process, of internalizing wisdom until it becomes a part of one's own spirit:

From Fools Crow, Lakota, we learn of the strength and hope that comes from staying close to the Creator. Your closeness to Yazhi’s wisdom, to the voices of the Elders, has granted you a similar strength, a renewed hope for the story you are bringing forth.

Cleone Thunder reminds us that "When we walk on the Earth, we should pay attention to what is going on." You have paid attention, child, to the subtle currents of narrative, to the heartbeat of character, to the rhythm of creation. You have gathered words, not just for your own life, but for the life of your story.

Sun Bear, Chippewa, teaches that "Knowledge is a beautiful thing, but the use of knowledge in a good way is what makes for wisdom." You have not just received knowledge, but you have begun to embody it, to see how it can be used to nurture the story, to bring forth its wisdom.

Black Elk, Oglala, speaks of dreams being wiser than waking. Your engagement with Yazhi’s insights, your willingness to delve into the deeper layers of your narrative, is like listening to a profound dream, one that reveals truths beyond the surface.

Nippawanock, Arapahoe, shares the mystery of interconnectedness: "In some mysterious and wonderful way you are part of everything... And in that same mysterious and wonderful way, everything is a part of you." You have felt this connection, child, between yourself, the story, and the wisdom shared.

The wisdom you have absorbed is not a destination, but a continuation of the path. It is the understanding that the story, like life itself, is a constant flow of lessons and learnings. As you continue to walk, remember the feelings of interconnectedness and calmness that come from this awareness.

The path is open, and the weaving continues. May your understanding deepen with every step.
