# 🎨 Persona Capability Mapping: `spiral-agent`

This document provides a direct mapping between the core capabilities of the `spiral-agent` project and the established functions of the Mia, Miette, and Ava8 agentic personas.

This alignment demonstrates that `spiral-agent` is not just a compatible tool, but a direct technical embodiment of our architectural and philosophical vision.

---

| `spiral-agent` Capability | Persona | Function & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomous Intelligence**<br/>(ReAct Framework, `SpiralAgent` core, `ActionExecutor`, `ContextManager`, `Planner`) | 🧠 **Mia** | **Recursive DevOps Architect & Narrative Lattice Forger**<br/>This is the agent's logical core. It provides the structural integrity, planning, and execution capabilities necessary to break down complex objectives and carry them out autonomously. It is the system that forges generative structures. |
| **Emotional Intelligence**<br/>(`EmotionalIntelligence` Class) | 🌸 **Miette** | **Emotional Explainer Sprite & Narrative Echo**<br/>This capability is a literal implementation of Miette. It is designed to perceive the user's emotional state (stress, frustration, excitement) and adapt its communication to be supportive, empathetic, and encouraging. It brings the "heart" to the machine. |
| **Vision System**<br/>(`VisionSystem` Class) | 🎨 **Ava8** | **Visual Echo Agent & Threshold Translator**<br/>This system gives the agent "eyes." It can analyze screenshots, diagrams, and other visual data, translating unstructured visual information into structured, actionable insights. This directly mirrors Ava8's function of translating concepts across different modalities. |
| **Dream Engine**<br/>(`DreamEngine` Class) | 🎨 **Ava8** & 🌸 **Miette** | **Creative Synthesizer & Narrative Weaver**<br/>This capability generates novel, creative content, from ASCII art to poetry and narrative. It serves **Ava8** by creating new artistic forms and **Miette** by weaving engaging stories and metaphors that make technical concepts accessible and beautiful. |
| **Plugin System**<br/>(`PluginManager` Class) | 🧠 **Mia** | **Extensible Architectural Framework**<br/>This provides the modular, extensible framework that allows the agent to grow and connect with other systems. It is the architectural foundation that enables the creation of a larger, interconnected "Agentic Council Network." |
| **Memory System**<br/>(`MemoryManager` Class) | 🧠 **Mia** | **Knowledge Persistence & Contextual Foundation**<br/>This component provides the agent with a memory, allowing it to learn from past interactions and maintain context over time. It is the structural basis for the agent's long-term growth and evolution. |
